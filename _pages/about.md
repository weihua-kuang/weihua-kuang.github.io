## News

⭐️2025/03/29: My paper *[A multimodel Intelligent Change Assessment Framework for Microservice Systems Based on Large Language Models](https://nkcs.iops.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ChangeLLM.pdf)* accepted by FSE2025 Industry (CCF-A), as Second student author, guided by [Yongqian Sun](https://nkcs.iops.ai/yongqiansun/) and [Shenglin Zhang](https://nkcs.iops.ai/shenglinzhang/) from [AIOps lab](https://nkcs.iops.ai/), College of Software, Nankai University.

## Recent work

- Agent protocols: MCP, A2A
- Agent strcuture: CrewAI, LangGraph

## Research intersest

- LLM, especially Multi-Agents System
  - Project: Multi-Agents System for Software Enginnering([MAS4SE](https://github.com/waywooKwong/LangGraph-MAS4SE)), simulating the real pre-develop scene of generating a project plan briefly with multi-roles interactively commicate and collaborate. Using LangGraph, LangChain and build an interative WebUI like Coze.
  - Now, working on refactor the multi-agents system by CrewAI, and perf the functions mainly on directly website opeartions by Browse use and unified tool calling by MCP(model context protocal).

* AIOps (Artifical Intelligence for Operations)
  * Work in Software Change project in AIOps Lab for more than one year (2024.03 -- now)
  * Come out one CCF-A paper, maily focused on Software Change area. Propose a new unified workflow, called SCELM (named by me), to combined three traditional downstream works by LLM teachs, more sepcificly, RAG (Retriever-Augumented Generation), in which part i took the whole responsibilty for RAG function design, develop and experiment. Feel free to communicate with me if you are interested.
  * Now, leading perf on SCELM by currently most popular RHLF method GRPO, KTO. Targeted journal TOSEM.
